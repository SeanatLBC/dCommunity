BITCOIN IS THE COLLATERAL LAYER:

Without Bitcoin - Many of the innovations we are seeing emerge would not be happening....(actually - most of them). It is with this in mind, that keeping up to date with developments of the core protocol and overall adoption of Bitcoin is so important. Where Bitcoin goes...so will the rest of the market (At least for now)

Bitcoin Genesis Block - Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin Whitepaper "Bitcoin: A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System". A few months later, the first bitcoin transaction took place.

The Bitcoin Genesis Block contains this message (taken from the front page of Times of London): "The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"

This is the Hash for the 1st transaction (see what happens when you search this on one of the public ledger Explorers posted below): Tx:000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
